11:36:10 From wquraishi to Everyone:
	What is the core difference between RTO and MTD , they someway mean the same ?
11:36:43 From Sherinay to Everyone:
	MTD = max point. RTO = least point
11:36:45 From Sherinay to Everyone:
	I think
11:37:35 From Sherinay to Everyone:
	MTD time > RTO time
11:37:54 From Monzer "Mike" to Everyone:
	MTD=maximum Tolerable Downtime
11:39:02 From Barzan Ahmed to Everyone:
	MTD is about the maximum allowable downtime before the business suffers significant and possibly irreversible damage. RTO is about the specific target time within which systems and functions must be restored after an outage.

11:47:47 From Shawn Ahmed to Everyone:
	Were we talking about MTBF?
11:47:51 From Syed A to Everyone:
	Yeah, it's mtbf is confusing, if we are taking mean

11:48:34 From Arshad Shaikh to Everyone:
	MTBF = time between failures. lower time between failures, = more failures
11:49:05 From Syed A to Everyone:
	A high MTBF can mean fewer problems and costs for your equipment; a lower one could mean more frequent failures and more expenses.

11:51:38 From M Ali to Everyone:
	Yep, We want more time between failures ( so higher MTBF)  better
11:51:49 From Syed A to Everyone:
	High MTBF. Finally, consider a system that only goes down once within 30 days (720 hours) for two hours. Compared to the other scenarios described here,¬†one failure every 30 days¬†can be considered a high MTBF, indicating that the system is highly reliable.
